    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Someday, a real rain will come and wash all this scum off the streets. Until then, enjoy this recipe for Mom's Mayo. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large egg, room temperature.</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dijon mustard</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon red or white wine vinegar.</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt. Preferably kosher.</li>
        <li>1 cup canola oil. Don't fuck around and use regular vegetable oil, alright?</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lemon juice </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Blend it all. Hey, make sure you crack the egg first. No shells, I mean it.</li>
        <li>If it's too thin for you, use more oil. <strong>Remember:</strong> more oil means more pushups and situps added to your routine.</li>
        <li>Put that in the fridge three days at least. Stay awake until it's finished.</li>
        <li>Note: you can throw a little yellow mustard in here to give it a zing. If you want.</li>
        <li>Enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
