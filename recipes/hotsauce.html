    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>We need to sort somethin' out right here and now. The closest I usually get to hot is when I cruise over steaming <br> 
        manhole covers in my cab at 3am.  When I want an inferno filled with demons, I drive through the Bronx.<br> 
        Some say variety is the spice of life. I have to disagree. Spice is the spice of life. Suck on this!  
        </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Around 20 hot peppers.</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups apple cider vinegar.</li>
        <li>Minced garlic, whatever you want.</li>
        <li>Other seasonings. Use your imagination. Just don't forget the salt, ok?</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice the peppers lengthwise. Imagine something terrible and/or Calvinist when you do it.</li>
        <li>Boil the peppers in a pan with the vinegar. Stare into the bubbles until the slow zoom is finished.</li>
        <li>Get those peppers soft like the skin of a woman who rejects you.</li>
        <li>When they're soft, just pour all that scum in a blender. Seeds and everything. Blend it up.</li>
        <li>Bottle it, keep it in a bowl. Just don't put your hands in your pants without washing them first.</li>
    </ol>
