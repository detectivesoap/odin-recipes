    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>One of these days, I'm gonna get organezized. But until then, I'll be gulping down this delicious alfredo sauce <br> I make right in my kitchen here. 
        I think about this stuff day and night, but especially when I have to clean the <br>backseat of my cab. Hey, it's not so bad. Other nights, I'm cleaning up the blood.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup of butter</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garlic minced</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon pepper</li>
        <li>2 cups freshly grated parmesan cheese (not the powdered bullshit)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt the butter in a deep, dark pan.</li>
        <li>Pour on that heavy cream.</li>
        <li>Stir that around. Get some little bubbles going. Stare at the bubbles until the slow zoom is finished.</li>
        <li>Pop those seasonings in there.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle and stir the parmesan. Keep doin' it till you have no parmesan left. If you're getting clumpy, <br> you don't stir fast enough. You could also use a blender.</li>
        <li>Enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
